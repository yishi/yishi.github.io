One graph is worth hundred words.

But what graphs we should use and how to use them are a big question.

**[Here](https://nbviewer.org/github/yishi/Data-Visualization-In-Python/blob/master/data_visualization_gallery.ipynb)**, I make a simple summary about the type of the graphs and where to use them.

If you want to known more information, please refer the book of **Visualize This** or the website http://flowingdata.com/ .
