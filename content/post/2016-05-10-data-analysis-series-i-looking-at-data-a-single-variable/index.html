<p>Imagine your boss comes to you and says: “Here are 50GB of logfiles - find a way to improve our business!”</p>
<p>What is your plan?</p>
<p>The first step is: look at the data by plotting it in different ways and looking at graphs.</p>
<p>Looking at data, you will notice things - the manner in which one quantity varies with another, or the large number of outliers …</p>
<p>I don’t know what you will find, but there is no doubt: <strong>if you look at data, you will find some hints!</strong></p>
<p>These observations should lead to some idea.</p>
<p>“Every seven days we have a production run that has twice the usual defect rate, and it’s always on a Thursday.”</p>
<p>To make these ideas concrete and suitable for further work, it is often useful to express them in a model, such as predictive model.</p>
<p>You can predict that next Thursday the defect rate will be high again.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may already be finished at this point: you found out enough to help improve the business.</p>
<p>At other times, you may need to work a little harder.</p>
<p><strong>A single Variable: Shape and Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at the examples which concerns a relatively small data set: the number of months that the various American presidents have spend in office.</p>
<p><strong>Dot and Rug Plots</strong></p>

We see the values of 48 and 96 months, which correspond to one and two full four-year terms in office, occur more frequently than others.</p>
<p>Even in this simple example, a plot reveals both something expected (the clusters at 48 and 96 months) and the unexpected (the larger number of points outside those clusters).</p>

<p><strong>Only When Appropriate: Summary Statistics and Box Plots</strong></p>
<p>Mean, median, and related summary statistics apply only to distributions that have a single, central peak.</p>
<p>If this basic assumption is not fulfilled, then conclusions based on simple summary statistics will be wrong.</p>
<p>Even worse, nothing will tip you off that they are wrong: the numbers will look quite reasonable.</p>
<p>Mean and standard deviation are easy to calculate, and have certain nice mathematical properties - provided the data is symmetric and does not contain crazy outliers.</p>
<p>A different set of summary statistics that is both more flexible and more robust is based on the concepts of median and quantiles or percentiles.</p>
<p>The median is a measure for the location of the distribution, and we can use percentiles to construct a measure for the width of the distribution. Probably the most frequently used quantity for this purpose is the inter-quartile range (IQR), which is the distance between the 75th percentile and 25th percentile.</p>
<p>When should you favor median and percentile over mean and standard deviation?</p>
<p>Whenever you suspect that your distribution is not symmetric or has important outliers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>### box plot
ggplot(df_office, aes(x = 1, y = months_in_office)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) +

plt.close(&#39;all&#39;)

The box plot emphasizes the overall structure of the data sets and make it easy to compare the data sets based on their location and width.</p>
<p>At the same time, it also loses much information.The KDE gives a more detailed view of the data.</p>
<p><strong>Violin Plot</strong></p>
<p>Violin plot, which combines a box plot with the kernel density estimation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>### violin plot
