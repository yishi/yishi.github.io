Map function in **tidyverse** package is awesome.

Let us look at one example.

+ First of all, we split the dateset “mtcars”" into 3 data frames by variable “cyl”.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>%
  str()
```

Then, we want to make linear regression models to 3 data frames at the same time.

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>%
  map(~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))
```

Wonderful!
