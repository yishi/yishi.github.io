When you plot a bar plot by ggplot2, you may be want to change the order of factor levels.

For example:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

temp <- data.frame(x = factor(letters[1:4]), y = c(34, 23, 15, 46))

ggplot(temp, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

If you want to order the bar by decreasing, you need to change the order of factor levels by y.

```{r}
temp$x

temp$x <- reorder(temp$x, temp$y)

temp$x

ggplot(temp, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

or you also could also want to use other methods, for example:
```{r}
temp$x <- factor(temp$x, levels = as.character(temp$x[order(temp$y)]))
```
