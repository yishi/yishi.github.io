Now, "big data" is a hot word, not only in United States, but also in China.

But, what is big data?

People always said, I have TB or PB degrees of data, this is a big data.

To me, above 4GB is big data.

The reason is: The memory of my laptop is 4GB. 

I often use R to analysis my data.

R is a tool, mainly use memory to save my data and compute some interesting things.

When I get data about 5.18GB, and I want to load the whole data, what can I do?

I think this is a good chance to use so-called big data tools to analysis my data.

So, I start my exploration trip about spark.
