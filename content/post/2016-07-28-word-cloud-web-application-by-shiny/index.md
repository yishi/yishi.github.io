Today, I want to introduce my word cloud web application by shiny.

<iframe src="https://beibeikong.shinyapps.io/word_cloud_for_english/" width="850" height="750" class="frame_style"></iframe>

The detail about the example text in my web app and the weight method which you can choose, all are explained in my blog article.

In this simple word cloud web app:

+ you could upload your text, make the word cloud, get the word frequency.

+ you have the free to choose the weight method you like;

+ you have the right to decide how many words appeared in the word cloud.

Please note: In this web app, one paragraph is treated as one document to compute the weight word frequency.

Welcome your advice and suggestion!
