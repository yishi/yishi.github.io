For example:

```{r}
temp <- data.frame(char = c("1", "2", "2", "2", "3", "3", "4", "4", "5"))
```

I want to have a variable to order my character between different numbers, Confusing? 

Like this:  1 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 1

How can we create the variable like that?

Just two steps:

+ First of all, compute how many every same char?

```{r}
library(plyr)

temp2 <- ddply(temp, "char", nrow)

temp2 
```

+ Second, generate sequence.

```{r}
temp$new_variable <- unlist(lapply(temp2$V1, function(x) seq(length.out = x)))

temp 
```

Why I do this?

Just for plot by ggplot2.
