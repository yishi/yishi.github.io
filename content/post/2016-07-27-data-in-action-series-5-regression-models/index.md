The data set is made up of Boston house prices.

There are two articles (regression model series I and II) in my blog to do regression models by Boston house prices data set in R, here is one in python.

Please refer the whole python code in [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/yishi/Data-In-Action-Series-in-Python/blob/master/data_in_action_series_5.ipynb).

Welcome your advice and suggestion!
